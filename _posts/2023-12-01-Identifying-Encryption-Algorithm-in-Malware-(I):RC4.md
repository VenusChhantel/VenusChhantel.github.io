## Background

Encryption serves as a sophisticated mechanism employing algorithms to convert plaintext into ciphertext, establishing as a stalwart guardian to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access. Yet, in the intricate game of cat and mouse between defenders and adversaries, encryption has also found an unwelcome application in the realm of malware.

Malware leverage encryption algorithm for anti-defense and anti-analysis. There are two approaches that malware author can take to leverage encryption, which are:

-   Using APIs
-   Coding encryption algorithms

In case of samples using API for encryption, it can be easily identified because Microsoft has documented most of those APIs.
