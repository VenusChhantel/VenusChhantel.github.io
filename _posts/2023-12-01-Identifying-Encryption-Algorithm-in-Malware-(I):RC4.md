## Background

Encryption serves as a sophisticated mechanism employing algorithms to convert plaintext into ciphertext, establishing as a stalwart guardian to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access. Yet, in the intricate game of cat and mouse between defenders and adversaries, encryption has also found an unwelcome application in the realm of malware.

Malware leverage encryption algorithm for anti-defense and anti-analysis. There are two approaches that malware author can take to leverage encryption, which are:

-   Using APIs
-   Coding encryption algorithms

<br>

In case of samples using API for encryption, it can be easily identified because Microsoft has documented most of those APIs.

- [Wincrypt.h](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/)
- [bcrypt.h](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptencrypt)

<br>

**Example**

Consider a sample that has functionality to decrypt obfuscated strings during run time. And for this, it uses  **CryptGenKey**  API from  **WinCrypt**  to generate cryptographic key, which handle will be passed to  **CryptDecrypt** to decrypt those obfuscated strings.

Following the  [Microsoft documentation on  **CryptGenKey**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecrypt)  as shown below, the second parameter it takes is Algorithm ID.

By checking the  [value of Algorithm ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/alg-id)  that is passed as second parameter to the  **CryptGenKey**  API, the encryption algorithm can be identified easily.

The usage of API made it easier to detect. But what if malware author codes cryptographic algorithm?

In such cases, malware analyst needs to understand the flow of cryptographic algorithm in order to identify them. So, this blog series will focus on identifying such algorithms. This first blog of this series will start with RC4.


## RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
